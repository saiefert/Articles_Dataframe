    abstract: 'The first paradigm of plant breeding involves direct selection
        based phenotypic observation, followed by predictive breeding using
        statistical models constructed for quantitative traits based on genetic
        experimental design and more recently by incorporating molecular marker
        genotypes. However, plant performance or phenotype (P) is determined
        by the combining effects of genotype (G), envirotype (E) and genotype
        by environment interaction (GEI). Phenotypes can be predicted more
        precisely by training a model using data collected from multiple sources,
        including spatiotemporal omics (genomics, phenomics and enviromics
        across time and space). Integration of 3D information profiles (G-P-E),
        each with multidimensionality, provides predictive breeding with both
        tremendous opportunities and great challenges. Here, we first review
        innovative technologies for predictive breeding. We then evaluate
        multidimensional information profiles that can be integrated with
        a predictive breeding strategy, particularly envirotypic data, which
        have largely been neglected in data collection and nearly untouched
        in model construction. We propose a smart breeding scheme, integrated
        genomic-enviromic prediction (iGEP), as an extension of genomic prediction,
        using integrated multiomics information, big data technology and artificial
        intelligence (mainly focus on machine and deep learning). How to implement
        iGEP was discussed, including spatiotemporal models, environmental
        indices, factorial and spatiotemporal structure of plant breeding
        data, and cross-species prediction. A strategy is then proposed for
        prediction-based crop redesign at both the macro (individual, population
        and species) and micro (gene, metabolism and network) scales. Finally,
        we provide perspectives on translating the smart breeding into genetic
        gain through integrative breeding platforms and open-source breeding
        initiatives. We call for coordinated efforts in smart breeding through
        iGEP, institutional partnerships, and innovative technological support.',

        data technology has become one of the important driving forces to

        characteristics of data in steel production are analyzed and an industrial
        big data platform for steeling process is developed to extract the

        intervals (PIs) of mechanical performances for hot-rolling strips
        is proposed to represent the uncertainty and reliability of the prediction
        results. The proposed method employs a new manifold visualization
        method, SLISEMAP, to reduce the feature dimensions with interpretability,
        utilizes lower upper bound estimation (LUBE) method to obtain the
        PIs, in which the broad learning system (BLS) is used as the basic
        training network model and the artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm
        is applied to optimize the weighting parameters of BLS under the LUBE
        framework. A hot-rolling steel coil dataset consisting of 39 variables
        and 1335 coil samples is used to validate the proposed method. Two
        Delta-based approaches, namely back propagation neural network (BPNN)
        and extreme learning machine (ELM); and three LUBE-based approaches,
        namely ABC-BPNN, ABC-ELM, and ABC-support vector regression (SVR)
        are compared with the proposed method. Results show that the proposed
        ABC-BLS in LUBE is effective and efficient in constructing the PIs

    abstract: 'With current decentralization trends and polycentric planning
        efforts, the urban spatial structures of Chinese cities have been
        changing tremendously. To detect the true urban polycentric pattern
        of Chinese cities, this article analyzed the urban polycentricity
        characteristics of 294 cities. The natural cities were delineated
        by points of interest (POIs), and road networks constituted street
        blocks. Based on check-in data and new spatial units, centers within
        both metropolitan areas and central cities were identified and examined.
        We discovered that all Chinese cities have at least one natural city
        in their metropolitan areas because of rapid urban sprawl. Although
        a monocentric structure is still the most common urban spatial structure,
        110 Chinese cities displayed different degrees of polycentricity at
        the metropolitan level. Many natural cities beyond central cities
        contribute to polycentric development at the metropolitan level. Central
        cities have maintained their original vitality and importance, most
        Chinese cities have dispersed urban structures in central cities,
        and 45 central cities are polycentric. The spatial structures in metropolitan
        areas are more polycentric than those in central cities. The only
        36 cities with polycentric urban structures at both the metropolitan
        and central city levels are all national or regional central cities

        is clear that big data has numerous potential impacts in many fields.
        However, few papers discussed its applications in the field of safety
        science research. Additionally, there exist many problems that cannot
        be ignored when big data is applied to safety science, most outstanding
        of which is lack of universal supporting theory that guides how to
        apply big data to safety science research like methods, principles
        and approaches, etc. In other terms, it is not enough for big data
        to be viewed asa strong enabler for safety science applications mainly
        due to lack of universal and basic theory from the perspective of
        safety science. Considering the above analyzes, the two key objectives
        of this paper are: (1) to propose the connotation of safety big data
        (SBD) and its applying rules, methods and principles, and (2) to put
        forward some application prospects and challenges of big data to safety
        science research seen from theoretical research. First, by comparing
        SBD and traditional safety small data (SSD) from four aspects including
        theoretical research, typical research method, specific analysis method
        and processing mode, this paper puts forward the definition and connotation
        of SBD. Subsequently this paper further summarizes and extracts the
        application rules and methods of SBD. And then nine principles of
        SBD are explored and their relationship and application are addressed
        from the view of theory architecture and working framework in data
        processing flow. At last, this paper also discusses the potential
        applications and some hot issues of SBD. Overall, this paper will
        play an essential role in supporting the application of SBD. In addition,
        it will fill in the theory gaps in the field of SBD beyond traditional
        safety statistics, and further enriches the contents of safety science.',

        of manufacturing and it can lead to remarkable changes in all aspects
        of operations through minimizing energy and material usage while simultaneously
        maximizing sustainability enabling a futuristic more digitalized scenario
        of manufacturing. This research develops a big data analytics framework
        that optimizes the maintenance schedule through condition-based maintenance
        (CBM) optimization and also improves the prediction accuracy to quantify
        the remaining life prediction uncertainty. Through effective utilization
        of condition monitoring and prediction information, CBM would enhance
        equipment reliability leading to reduction in maintenance cost. The
        proposed framework uses a CBM optimization method that utilizes a
        new linguistic interval-valued fuzzy reasoning method for predicting
        the information. The proposed big data analytics framework in our
        study for estimating the uncertainty based on backward feature elimination
        and fuzzy unordered rule induction algorithm prediction errors, is
        an innovative contribution to the remaining life prediction field.
        Our paper elaborates on the basic underlying structure of CBM system
        that is defined by transaction matrix and the threshold value of failure
        probability. We developed this framework for analysing the CBM policy

        concerns. Previous risk models for renal failure mostly rely on the
        diagnosis of chronic kidney disease, which lacks obvious clinical
        symptoms and thus is mostly undiagnosed, causing significant omission
        of high-risk patients. In this paper, we proposed a framework to predict
        the risk of renal failure directly from a big data repository of chronic
        disease population without prerequisite diagnosis of chronic kidney
        disease. The electronic health records of 42,256 patients with hypertension
        or diabetes in Shenzhen Health Information Big Data Platform were
        collected, with 398 suffered from renal failure during a 3-year follow-up.
        Five state-of-the-art machine learning methods are utilized to build
        risk prediction models of renal failure for chronic disease population.
        Extensive experimental results show that the proposed framework achieves
        quite well performance. Particularly, the XGBoost obtains the best
        performance with an area under receiving-operating-characteristics
        curve (AUC) of 0.9139. By analyzing the effect of risk factors, we
        identified that serum creatine, age, urine acid, systolic blood pressure,
        and blood urea nitrogen are the top five factors associated with renal
        failure risk. Compared with existing models, our model can be deployed
        into routine chronic disease management procedures and enable more
        preemptive, widely-covered screening of renal risks, which would in
        turn reduce the damage caused by the disease through timely intervention.',

        sensor networks implies the generation of huge volumes of data from
        multiple geographical locations at an increasing rate. This raises
        important issues which become more challenging when the final goal
        is that of the analysis of the data for forecasting purposes or, more
        generally, for predictive tasks. This paper proposes a framework which
        supports predictive modeling tasks from streaming data coming from
        multiple geo-referenced sensors. In particular, we propose a distance-based
        anomaly detection strategy which considers objects described by embedding
        features learned via a stacked auto-encoder. We then devise a repair
        strategy which repairs the data detected as anomalous exploiting non-anomalous
        data measured by sensors in nearby spatial locations. Subsequently,
        we adopt Gradient Boosted Trees (GBTs) to predict/forecast values
        assumed by a target variable of interest for the repaired newly arriving
        (unlabeled) data, using the original feature representation or the
        embedding feature representation learned via the stacked auto-encoder.
        The workflow is implemented with distributed Apache Spark programming
        primitives and tested on a cluster environment. We perform experiments
        to assess the performance of each module, separately and in a combined
        manner, considering the predictive modeling of one-day-ahead energy
        production, for multiple renewable energy sites. Accuracy results
        show that the proposed framework allows reducing the error up to 13.56%.

        \ the age of big data, intelligence, and Industry 4.0, intelligence\
        \ plays an increasingly significant role in management or, more specifically,\
        \ decision making; thus, it becomes a popular topic and is recognised\
        \ as an important discipline. Hence, safety intelligence (SI) as a\
        \ new safety concept and term was proposed. SI aims to transform raw\
        \ safety data and information into meaningful and actionable information\
        \ for safety management; it is considered an essential perspective\
        \ for safety management in the era of Safety 4.0 (computational safety\
        \ science\u2014a new paradigm for safety science in the age of big\
        \ data, intelligence, and Industry 4.0). However, thus far, no existing\
        \ research provides a framework that comprehensively describes SI\
        \ and guides the implementation of SI practices in organisations.\
        \ To address this research gap and to provide a framework for SI and\
        \ its practice in the context of safety management, based on a systematic\
        \ and comprehensive explanation on SI from different perspectives,\
        \ this study attempts to propose a theoretical framework for SI from\
        \ a safety management perspective and then presents an SI practice\
        \ model aimed at supporting safety management in organisations.",

    series: .nan, location: .nan, abstract: 'The construction of medical big
        data includes several problems that need to be solved, such as integration
        and data sharing of many heterogeneous information systems, efficient
        processing and analysis of large-scale medical data with complex structure
        or low degree of structure, and narrow application range of medical
        data. Therefore, medical big data construction is not only a simple
        collection and application of medical data but also a complex systematic
        project. This paper introduces China''s experience in the construction
        of a regional medical big data ecosystem, including the overall goal
        of the project; establishment of policies to encourage data sharing;
        handling the relationship between personal privacy, information security,
        and information availability; establishing a cooperation mechanism
        between agencies; designing a polycentric medical data acquisition
        system; and establishing a large data centre. From the experience
        gained from one of China''s earliest established medical big data
        projects, we outline the challenges encountered during its development
        and recommend approaches to overcome these challenges to design medical
        big data projects in China more rationally. Clear and complete top-level
        design of a project requires to be planned in advance and considered
        carefully. It is essential to provide a culture of information sharing
        and to facilitate the opening of data, and changes in ideas and policies
        need the guidance of the government. The contradiction between data
        sharing and data security must be handled carefully, that is not to
        say data openness could be abandoned. The construction of medical
        big data involves many institutions, and high-level management and
        cooperation can significantly improve efficiency and promote innovation.
        Compared with infrastructure construction, it is more challenging
        and time-consuming to develop appropriate data standards, data integration
        tools and data mining tools.', doi: 'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbi.2019.103149',
